Hey
Hey
Hey
Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I let you go and blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight
Hey
Hey
Hey
Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind
Hey, soul sister
Ain't thatâ€¦
